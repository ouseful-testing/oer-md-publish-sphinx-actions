# oer-md-publish

Template repo for autobuilding nbsphinx sites using Github Actions.

This template repository can be used as a basis for creating documentation sites that are auto-built using Github Actions, using Sphinx / nbSphinx to produce a website published via Github Pages (`gh-pages` branch) from text and Jupyter notebook documents.

Jupytext is installed so that text files (`.py`, `.md`, etc) can be executed as notebooks via Jupytext.

Code execution is disabled by default in the `nbsphinx` configuration file (`conf.py`).
